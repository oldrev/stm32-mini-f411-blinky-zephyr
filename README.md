# A Zephyr-RTOS Blinky Demo for BluePill-Like STM32F411CEU6 Development Board


** This is a mistake; I didn't know there was already an existing package in the Zephyr source tree called `blackpill_f411ce` that supports BluePill-Like boards. **


## How To Run


```
west flash -b blackpill_f411ce
```



Tested with Zephyr 2.4.99.
